# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
This project is designed give the user the weather outlook for multiple cities

## Why It Doesn't Work
I believe most of my problems are coming from line 6 - 22 of homepage.js. When I run developer tools in the browser, it gives me a "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')" error on line 82 of homepage.js, but I think this is because of formSubmitHandler(). I went back through the module and used it to help me with this project, but I could never escape errors. I have run out of time but I will be revisiting the project again to try and find my mistakes.

## Built With
